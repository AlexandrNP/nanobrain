  biological_analogy: "Myelinated axon connection"
  justification: >
    Like how myelinated axons provide fast, reliable signal transmission
    between neurons, LinkDirect provides fast, reliable data transfer
    between components.
  objectives:
    - Transfer data directly from source to target
    - Maintain high reliability and minimal loss
    - Support automatic data transfer on changes
    - Adapt connection strength based on usage

validation:
  required:
    - class  # Class path
    - input_data  # Source data unit
    - output_data  # Target data unit
  optional:
    - reliability
    - connection_strength
    - signal_decay
    - trigger
    - auto_transfer
  constraints:
    class:
      type: str
