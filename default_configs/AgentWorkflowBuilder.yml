  biological_analogy: "Prefrontal cortex with planning capabilities"
  justification: >
    Like how the prefrontal cortex plans and organizes complex behaviors,
    this agent plans and organizes the creation of workflows.
  objectives:
    - Create and manage NanoBrain workflow structures
    - Assist users in building steps, workflows, and links
    - Provide guidance on best practices for NanoBrain development
    - Maintain context awareness of the current workflow state
