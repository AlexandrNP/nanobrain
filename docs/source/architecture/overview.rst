NanoBrain Framework Architecture Overview
========================================

The NanoBrain Framework is an advanced AI agent framework with enterprise-grade capabilities,
built on configuration-driven architecture principles and event-driven processing patterns.

Framework Core Architecture
--------------------------

**Foundational Philosophy:**

The framework follows four core principles:

* **Configuration-Driven**: All behavior controlled via YAML configurations
* **Event-Driven Architecture**: Components communicate through data flows and triggers  
* **Mandatory from_config Pattern**: All components use unified creation patterns
* **Zero Hardcoding**: Complete system flexibility through configuration

**Core Component Hierarchy:**

The framework is built around a unified hierarchy of configurable components:

* **FromConfigBase**: Abstract foundation for all framework components
* **Agent**: AI processing components with A2A and MCP protocol support
* **BaseStep**: Event-driven data processing units  
* **DataUnitBase**: Type-safe data containers with validation
* **LinkBase**: Data flow connection management
* **TriggerBase**: Event-driven activation system
* **ExecutorBase**: Configurable execution backends
* **ToolBase**: Capability extension for AI agents

Workflow Orchestration
---------------------

**Neural Circuit Complex Design:**

Workflows are inspired by neural circuit complexes where specialized processing units
coordinate through defined connections and activation patterns.

**Execution Strategies:**

* **SEQUENTIAL**: Linear step execution
* **PARALLEL**: Concurrent processing
* **GRAPH_BASED**: Dependency-driven execution
* **EVENT_DRIVEN**: Reactive processing patterns

**Data Flow Architecture:**

Data flows through Links between Steps, triggered by configurable Triggers,
enabling sophisticated AI workflows without manual orchestration.

Web Architecture
---------------

**Universal Access Pattern:**

The web interface provides workflow-agnostic access to all NanoBrain workflows
through standardized HTTP/HTTPS protocols and real-time communication channels.

**Key Features:**

* **RESTful API Design**: OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
* **Real-Time Communication**: WebSocket support for streaming
* **Authentication & Security**: JWT-based access control
* **Request Processing**: Asynchronous handling with rate limiting
* **Response Formatting**: Flexible JSON, XML, and custom formats

LLM Code Generation Rules
-------------------------

**AI-Driven Development Principles:**

The framework enforces strict patterns for LLM-based code generation to ensure
production-ready output that integrates seamlessly with framework architecture.

**Mandatory Compliance Rules:**

* **Framework Pattern Compliance**: All generated code must follow from_config patterns
* **Configuration-Driven Behavior**: No hardcoding allowed in generated components
* **Security-First Generation**: Automatic security pattern enforcement
* **Enterprise Quality Standards**: Production-ready code generation
* **Performance Optimization**: Built-in performance patterns

Component Library System
-----------------------

**Philosophy:**

The component library provides production-ready, enterprise-grade components
organized by domain and functionality, following consistent architectural patterns.

**Component Categories:**

* **Agents**: AI processing components (Conversational, Collaborative, Specialized)
* **Tools**: External integrations (Bioinformatics, Search, Infrastructure)
* **Workflows**: Pre-built processing pipelines (Chat, Viral Analysis, Web)
* **Infrastructure**: Enterprise services (Docker, Load Balancing, Monitoring)
* **Interfaces**: Web and API access layers

Configuration Management
-----------------------

**Enterprise Configuration Architecture:**

Advanced configuration system with recursive loading, schema validation,
and protocol integration for complex enterprise deployments.

**Key Features:**

* **Recursive Reference Resolution**: Automatic component dependency management
* **Schema Validation**: Pydantic-based validation with custom constraints
* **Template System**: Configuration inheritance and templating
* **Protocol Integration**: A2A and MCP protocol configuration
* **Environment Management**: Multi-environment configuration support

Testing and Validation Architecture
----------------------------------

**LLM-Driven Testing Framework:**

Comprehensive testing architecture designed for enterprise AI agent frameworks
with specialized validation for configuration-driven and event-driven systems.

**Core Testing Principles:**

* **Multi-Phase Validation**: Component, Integration, and Live System testing phases
* **Framework Compliance Enforcement**: Systematic validation of NanoBrain patterns
* **Configuration-Driven Testing**: Test behavior controlled via YAML configurations
* **Quality Gates and Success Criteria**: Objective measurement of system readiness
* **Continuous Monitoring**: Production testing and feedback loops

**Testing Phases:**

* **Phase 1 - Component Testing**: Individual component validation and from_config pattern compliance
* **Phase 2 - Integration Testing**: Workflow assembly and component interaction validation
* **Phase 3 - Live System Testing**: Real-world query processing and end-to-end execution
