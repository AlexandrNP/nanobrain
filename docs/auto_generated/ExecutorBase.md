# ExecutorBase

Base executor class to execute Runnable objects.

Biological analogy: Neurotransmitter systems controlling neural activation.
Justification: Like how different neurotransmitter systems (e.g., glutamatergic,
cholinergic) control the activation of different neural circuits, executor
classes control the activation of different types of runnables.

## Methods

### can_execute

```python
def can_execute(self, runnable_type: str) -> bool
```

Checks if this executor can handle the specified runnable type.

Biological analogy: Receptor specificity in neural signaling.
Justification: Like how neurons have specific receptors that respond
only to certain neurotransmitters, executors have specific types of
runnables they can process.

### execute

```python
def execute(self, runnable) -> Any
```

Contains logic for running a specific Runnable implementation.

Biological analogy: Neurotransmitter-mediated activation.
Justification: Like how neurotransmitters trigger specific receptor-mediated
responses in target neurons, executors trigger specific execution logic in
target runnables.

### recover_energy

```python
def recover_energy(self)
```

Recovers energy over time.

Biological analogy: Metabolic recovery processes.
Justification: Like how neurons recover their energy reserves after
activity through metabolic processes, executors recover their
computational resources over time.

### get_modulator_effect

```python
def get_modulator_effect(self, name: str) -> float
```

Gets the effect of a system modulator on execution.

Biological analogy: Neuromodulatory effects on neural circuits.
Justification: Like how different neuromodulators (dopamine, serotonin)
affect neural circuits in different ways, system modulators affect
execution parameters differently.

### get_config

```python
def get_config(self, class_dir: str) -> dict
```

Get configuration for this class.

### update_config

```python
def update_config(self, updates: dict, adaptability_threshold: float) -> bool
```

Delegate to config manager.
