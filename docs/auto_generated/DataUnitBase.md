# DataUnitBase

Base class for data storage units.

Biological analogy: Memory storage in the brain.
Justification: Like how different brain regions store different types of
information with varying persistence, data units store different types of
data with configurable decay and persistence.

## Methods

### get

```python
def get(self) -> Any
```

Retrieves the stored data.

Biological analogy: Neuron activation and memory retrieval.
Justification: Like how neurons must reach activation threshold
to transmit signals, data units must pass activation checks to
retrieve data. This models the energy cost of memory access.

### set

```python
def set(self, data: Any)
```

Stores new data.

Biological analogy: Synaptic plasticity during memory formation.
Justification: Like how synapses strengthen during memory formation,
data units update their persistence level when storing new data.

### decay

```python
def decay(self)
```

Reduces persistence of stored data over time.

Biological analogy: Memory decay.
Justification: Like how memories fade over time without
reinforcement, stored data gradually loses persistence.

### consolidate

```python
def consolidate(self)
```

Strengthens persistence of important data.

Biological analogy: Memory consolidation.
Justification: Like how important memories are consolidated during
sleep and rest periods, important data is preserved through
increased persistence.

### get_config

```python
def get_config(self, class_dir: str) -> dict
```

Get configuration for this class.

### update_config

```python
def update_config(self, updates: dict, adaptability_threshold: float) -> bool
```

Delegate to config manager.
