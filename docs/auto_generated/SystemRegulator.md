# SystemRegulator

Maintains system stability by regulating component behavior.

Biological analogy: Homeostatic regulation in biological systems.
Justification: Like how the body maintains stable internal conditions despite
changing external conditions, software systems need mechanisms to maintain
operational stability despite varying loads and conditions.

## Methods

### regulate

```python
def regulate(self, current_value: float) -> float
```

Adjusts the current value toward the target if it's outside acceptable range.
Returns the correction factor to apply.

Biological analogy: Negative feedback loops in biological homeostasis.
Justification: Similar to how homeostatic mechanisms detect deviations from
optimal conditions and generate corrective responses proportional to the deviation.

### is_stable

```python
def is_stable(self) -> bool
```

Checks if the current value is within the acceptable range.
