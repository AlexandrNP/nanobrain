# LinkFile

File-based link implementation that transfers data via files.

Biological analogy: Indirect pathway with memory storage.
Justification: Like how some neural pathways involve intermediary processing
and temporary storage (e.g., hippocampal memory formation), file links
process and store data in files during transmission.
