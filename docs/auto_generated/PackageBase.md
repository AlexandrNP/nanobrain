# PackageBase

Base class for self-contained units with dependencies.

Biological analogy: Functional module in brain organization.
Justification: Like how the brain has functional modules that evolved to
handle specific tasks with defined connections to other modules, packages
are modular units with defined dependencies and interfaces.

## Methods

### check_dependencies

```python
def check_dependencies(self) -> bool
```

Checks if all dependencies are satisfied.

Biological analogy: Neural module requiring correct inputs.
Justification: Like how complex neural functions require proper inputs
from various brain regions, packages require proper dependencies to function.

### check_availability

```python
def check_availability(self) -> bool
```

Checks if this package is available for use by others.

Biological analogy: Neural readiness for activation.
Justification: Like how neurons must be in the appropriate state
to respond to incoming signals, packages must be in the appropriate
state to be used by other components.

### get_relative_path

```python
def get_relative_path(self) -> str
```

Delegate to directory tracer.

### get_absolute_path

```python
def get_absolute_path(self) -> str
```

Delegate to directory tracer.

### get_config

```python
def get_config(self, class_dir: str) -> dict
```

Get configuration for this class.

Biological analogy: Localized gene expression.
Justification: Like how cells use their location to determine which
genes to express, components use their location to find appropriate
configuration.

### update_config

```python
def update_config(self, updates: dict, adaptability_threshold: float) -> bool
```

Delegate to config manager.
