# DeadlockDetector

Detects potential deadlocks in the workflow by monitoring dependency cycles.

Biological analogy: Neural circuits that detect and break pathological synchronization.
Justification: Like how the brain prevents seizures by detecting and disrupting over-synchronized
neural activity, this class prevents workflow deadlocks by detecting and breaking resource contention cycles.

## Methods

### request_resource

```python
def request_resource(self, owner_id: str, resource_id: str) -> bool
```

Attempts to acquire a resource lock.

Biological analogy: Competition for limited metabolic resources.
Justification: Like how neural circuits compete for limited metabolic
resources, components compete for computational resources.

### release_resource

```python
def release_resource(self, owner_id: str, resource_id: str)
```

Releases a resource lock.

Biological analogy: Release of metabolic resources after neural activity.
Justification: Like how neurons release metabolic resources after completing
activity, components should release computational resources after use.
