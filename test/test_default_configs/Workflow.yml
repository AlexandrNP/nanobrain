  description: |
    Container for multiple steps that can be executed in a coordinated manner.

  objective: |
    To provide a way to organize and execute multiple processing steps with
    dependencies and coordination.

  biological_analogy: |
    Functions like a functional brain network that coordinates the activity
    of multiple neural circuits to achieve a complex cognitive function.
