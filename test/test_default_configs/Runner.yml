  description: |
    Base class for objects that can be executed.

  objective: |
    To provide a standardized way to make components executable while
    managing their activation state and execution flow.

  biological_analogy: |
    Functions like a neuron with activation potential, integrating inputs
    and firing when conditions are met, followed by a recovery period.
